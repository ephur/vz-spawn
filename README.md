vz-spawn
========

A library and script to spawn OpenVZ Instances on RedHat based distros

The script provided serves as an example of how one may want to implement the OpenVZ python library. 

It's very minimal at this point, I hope to add more to it soon in order to have a completely fleshed out and worthy of sharing library. If time permits.... otherwise, here's a start for someone else.
